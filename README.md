# aXOlotl - Console Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**aXOlotl** is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

The game is simple and engaging, featuring a 3x3 grid where two players, represented by the symbols "X" and "O", take turns marking the spaces "[$]" in the grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

You need enter your names to start. aXOlotl doesn't allow to use any symbols except 1 to 9 numbers and choose already captured spaces, besides aXOlotl determines a draw if there is one. 

To make marking the grid easier, you can use the numpad on your keyboard to represent the positions on the grid. Each key on the numpad corresponds to a specific position, allowing you to quickly select where you want to place your mark.

Here's a typical numpad layout with symbols to illustrate:

```
╔═══╦═══╦═══╗
║ 7 ║ 8 ║ 9 ║  -> Top row of the grid
╠═══╬═══╬═══╣
║ 4 ║ 5 ║ 6 ║  -> Middle row of the grid
╠═══╬═══╬═══╣
║ 1 ║ 2 ║ 3 ║  -> Bottom row of the grid
╚═══╩═══╩═══╝
```

For example, pressing '7' will mark the top-left corner, '5' the center, and '3' the bottom-right. This makes gameplay more intuitive and fluid, especially in a console-based environment.
